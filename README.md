# gui_trainings

The python script FunctionPlotter.py requires PyQt5.

It creates a GUI that allows a user to plot a simple mathematical function, modify the graph, save the graph in different formats, write graph data to .txt file, etc.

This was my first pass at GUI development. So, don't feel disappointed at the layout.
